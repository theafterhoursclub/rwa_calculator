# RWA Calculator Implementation Plan

## Overview

This plan follows a **test-first approach** starting with User Acceptance Tests (UATs) that define expected inputs and outputs, then establishing contracts between components to enable isolated development and testing.

**Regulatory Framework Prioritisation**: The implementation follows a phased approach:
1. **Phase A: CRR (Basel 3.0)** - Current UK implementation (effective until 31 Dec 2026)
2. **Phase B: Basel 3.1** - Future UK implementation (effective from 1 Jan 2027 per PRA PS9/24)

This ensures we can validate against the current regulatory framework before extending to Basel 3.1.

## Regulatory Framework Differences

### Key Differences Between CRR (Basel 3.0) and Basel 3.1

| Area | CRR (Basel 3.0) | Basel 3.1 |
|------|-----------------|-----------|
| **Output Floor** | None | 72.5% of SA RWA |
| **IRB Scope** | All exposure classes permitted | Excludes central govt exposures, equity, large/mid corporates (revenue >€500m), CIUs |
| **PD Floors** | 0.03% (all) | Differentiated: 0.03% corp, 0.05% retail, 0.10% QRRE |
| **LGD Floors (A-IRB)** | Supervisory LGDs for F-IRB only | New A-IRB LGD floors (0%-25% by collateral) |
| **SME Supporting Factor** | Applies (0.7619 factor) | Withdrawn |
| **Infrastructure Supporting Factor** | Applies (0.75 factor) | Withdrawn |
| **Retail Threshold** | €1m aggregate exposure | £880k aggregate exposure |
| **SA Risk Weights** | CRR Tables | Revised tables (more granular LTV bands, due diligence requirements) |
| **Real Estate** | Whole loan approach | Split by LTV bands, ADC treatment |
| **Institutions** | ECRA with CQS | ECRA with SCRA fallback |
| **Specialised Lending** | Slotting approach | Slotting with revised weights |

### UK-Specific Deviations (Both Frameworks)

| Area | Standard Basel | UK Implementation |
|------|---------------|-------------------|
| Institution CQS 2 | 50% RW | 30% RW |
| SME Threshold | €50m turnover | £44m turnover |
| Retail Aggregate | €1m / £880k | £880k (Basel 3.1) |

### 1.2A CRR (Basel 3.0) Acceptance Test Scenarios

Each scenario defines **specific inputs** and **expected outputs** with hand-calculated values based on current CRR rules (EU 575/2013 as onshored into UK law).

#### Scenario Group CRR-A: Standardised Approach (SA) - CRR

| ID | Description | Key Inputs | Expected RWA | Regulatory Basis |
|----|-------------|------------|--------------|------------------|
| CRR-A1 | UK Sovereign exposure | £1m loan to UK Govt, CQS1 | £0 (0% RW) | CRR Art. 114 |
| CRR-A2 | Unrated corporate | £1m loan, no rating, no SME | £1m (100% RW) | CRR Art. 122 |
| CRR-A3 | Rated corporate CQS2 | £1m loan, A-rated | £500k (50% RW) | CRR Art. 122 |
| CRR-A4 | Institution ECRA CQS2 | £1m loan to UK bank, A-rated | £300k (30% RW) | CRR Art. 120 + UK deviation |
| CRR-A5 | Residential mortgage ≤80% LTV | £500k loan, 75% LTV | £175k (35% RW) | CRR Art. 125 |
| CRR-A6 | Residential mortgage >80% LTV | £850k loan, 85% LTV | £425k (50% avg RW) | CRR Art. 125 |
| CRR-A7 | Commercial real estate ≤50% LTV | £600k loan, 50% LTV | £300k (50% RW) | CRR Art. 126 |
| CRR-A8 | Off-balance sheet commitment | £1m undrawn (>1yr), 50% CCF | £500k EAD | CRR Art. 111 |
| CRR-A9 | Retail exposure | £50k loan to individual | £37.5k (75% RW) | CRR Art. 123 |

## Phase 2: Process Contracts

Define clear interfaces between components to enable isolated testing and parallel development.

### 2.1 Output Schema Strategy

The calculator will support both CRR and Basel 3.1 with a unified output schema that includes all fields, with framework-specific fields clearly marked.

```python
# Approach: Single comprehensive schema with framework indicators

@dataclass
class CalculationOutputSchema:
    """Output schema supporting both CRR and Basel 3.1."""

    # Framework identification
    regulatory_framework: Literal["CRR", "BASEL_3_1"]
    reporting_date: date

    # Common fields (both frameworks)
    exposure_reference: str
    counterparty_reference: str
    exposure_class: str
    approach: Literal["SA", "FIRB", "AIRB"]
    ead: Decimal
    risk_weight: Decimal
    rwa: Decimal

    # CRR-specific fields
    sme_supporting_factor_applied: bool | None  # CRR only
    infrastructure_supporting_factor_applied: bool | None  # CRR only
    crr_ccf_category: str | None  # CRR CCF categories

    # Basel 3.1-specific fields
    output_floor_applicable: bool | None  # B3.1 only
    rwa_pre_floor: Decimal | None  # B3.1 only
    rwa_sa_equivalent: Decimal | None  # B3.1 only

    pd_floor_applied: Decimal | None  # B3.1 differentiated floors
    lgd_floor_applied: Decimal | None  # B3.1 A-IRB floors
```

### 2.2 Contract Definitions

Each contract specifies:
- **Input schema** (Polars DataFrame schema)
- **Output schema** (Polars DataFrame schema)
- **Invariants** (rules that must always hold)
- **Error handling** (how failures are communicated)

- [x] Implement CRR CCF tables (Art. 111)
- [x] Implement CRR SME supporting factor (Art. 501)
- [x] Create CRR-A (SA) scenarios (12 scenarios)
- [x] Create CRR-B (F-IRB) scenarios (7 scenarios - wholesale only)
- [x] Generate expected output files (CSV, JSON, Parquet)

### In Progress
- [ ] Create CRR-C (A-IRB) scenarios
- [ ] Create CRR-D (CRM) scenarios
- [ ] Create CRR-E (Slotting) scenarios
- [ ] Create CRR-G (Provisions) scenarios
- [ ] Create CRR-H (Complex/Combined) scenarios

### Up Next (CRR Priority)
1. **Phase 1.2A (continued)**: Complete remaining CRR scenario groups (C, D, E, G, H)
2. **Phase 1.2A**: Create pytest acceptance tests that validate against expected outputs
3. **Phase 2**: Define process contracts
4. **Phase 3.1**: Implement CRR production components in `src/`
5. **Phase 3.1**: Complete CRR Marimo workbook orchestration

### Later (Basel 3.1)
1. **Phase 1.2B**: Create Basel 3.1 acceptance test shells
2. **Phase 3.2**: Extend for Basel 3.1 (with differentiated PD/LGD floors, no 1.06 factor)
3. **Phase 3.2**: Basel 3.1 Marimo workbook
4. **Phase 3.3**: Framework comparison workbook
