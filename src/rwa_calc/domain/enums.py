Domain enums for RWA calculator.

Defines core enumerations used throughout the calculation pipeline:
- RegulatoryFramework: CRR vs Basel 3.1 toggle
- ExposureClass: Credit risk exposure classifications
- ApproachType: Calculation approach (SA, F-IRB, A-IRB)
- CQS: Credit Quality Steps for external ratings
- CollateralType: Categories of eligible collateral
- IFRSStage: IFRS 9 provision staging

These enums provide type safety and self-documenting code for the
dual-framework support (CRR until Dec 2026, Basel 3.1 from Jan 2027).
