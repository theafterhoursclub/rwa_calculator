"""
Generate guarantee test fixtures for credit risk mitigation testing.

The output will be saved as `guarantee.parquet` ready to get picked up within the wider
testing process.

Guarantees provide unfunded credit protection through substitution approach:
    - Guaranteed portion takes risk weight of guarantor
    - Unguaranteed portion retains borrower's risk weight

Guarantee types for testing:
    - Sovereign guarantees (0% RW for CQS 1)
    - Bank/institution guarantees (20-50% RW)
    - Export credit agency guarantees
    - Parent company guarantees (intragroup)

CRM scenarios covered:
    D4: Guarantee substitution - £600k bank guarantee against £1m corporate
    H4: Full CRM chain - exposure + collateral + guarantee + provision

Usage:
    uv run python tests/fixtures/guarantee/guarantee.py
