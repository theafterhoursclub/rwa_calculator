# UK Credit Risk RWA Calculator

A high-performance, UK Credit Risk RWA calculator which is compliant for current (Basel 3.0) and 
PRA PS9/24 (Basel 3.1) Risk-Weighted Assets (RWA) calculator for credit risk, built with Python using Polars.
A toggle, allows the user to be able to switch between the calculation types. 

## Overview

This calculator implements the current UK and Basel 3.1 credit risk framework as adopted by the UK 
Prudential Regulation Authority (PRA) under PS9/24. It supports both Standardised Approach (SA) and 
Internal Ratings-Based (IRB) approaches with full Credit Risk Mitigation (CRM) capabilities.

### Key Features

- **Regulatory Compliance**: Full PRA PS9/24 / Basel 3.1 implementation / Basel 3.0 including UK-specific deviations
- **High Performance**: Polars-native vectorized calculations - no row-by-row iteration - utilising LazyFrame optimisations
- **Dual Approach Support**: Both Standardised (SA) and IRB (F-IRB & A-IRB) approaches
- **Complete CRM**: Collateral at counterparty/facility/loan level with supervisory haircuts and RWA-optimized allocation
- **Provisions/Impairments**: Full IFRS 9 ECL integration with EL comparison for IRB
- **Complex Hierarchies**: Support for multi-level exposure and counterparty hierarchies
- **Dynamic Classification**: Exposure class and approach determined from counterparty attributes
- **Audit Trail**: Full calculation transparency for regulatory review


## How it works:

- Counterparty hierarchies allow for lending groups (for Retail classification) and org groups 
(for parent ratings) to be calculated
- Facilities and loans are combined into a hierarchy internally
- Drawn amounts aggregate bottom-up from loans to facilities
- Undrawn amounts are calculated at the root facility level
- RWA is calculated on both drawn (loans) and undrawn (facilities) exposures
- Collateral is prorated to optimise RWA calculation
- Provisions are allocated to optimise the RWA calculation.

## Counterparty Hierarchies

### Lending Groups (Retail Classification)

Used to determine retail eligibility based on aggregate group exposure:

```
Lending Group Lead
├── Counterparty A (exposure: £400k)
├── Counterparty B (exposure: £200k)
└── Sub-Group Lead
    └── Counterparty C (exposure: £150k)
Total: £750k - below £880k threshold, qualifies for retail treatment
```

- Exposure aggregated to root group level
- Threshold comparison determines retail eligibility (£880k per PRA PS9/24)
- No rating inheritance from lead

### Org Hierarchy (Rating & Turnover Inheritance)

Used for rating and SME classification:

```
Org Lead (CQS 2, turnover: £80M)
├── Subsidiary A (inherits CQS 2, £80M)
├── Subsidiary B (inherits CQS 2, £80M)
└── Sub-Org Lead (inherits CQS 2, £80M)
    └── Subsidiary C (inherits CQS 2, £80M)
```

- Rating cascades from root through entire hierarchy
- Turnover cascades for SME classification


## Exposure Hierarchy Model

The calculator uses a **facilities + loans** hierarchy model where:
- **Facilities** define committed credit limits (parent nodes)
- **Loans** represent actual drawings (leaf nodes)

### Data Model

Facilities and loans are loaded as separate files and combined internally:

```yaml
# rwa_config.yaml
data_paths:
  facilities: "data/{period}/facilities.parquet"   # Required
  loans: "data/{period}/loans.parquet"             # Required
  counterparties: "data/{period}/counterparties.parquet"
```

The hierarchy supports unlimited nesting:

```
Master Facility (committed: £10M)
├── Sub-Facility A (committed: £6M)
│   ├── Loan A1 (drawn: £2M)
│   └── Loan A2 (drawn: £1.5M)
└── Sub-Facility B (committed: £4M)
    └── Loan B1 (drawn: £3M)
```

### Reporting View Output

The `extract_reporting_view()` function produces a flattened view for RWA calculation with **both facilities and loans**:

| external_id | node_type | drawn_amount | undrawn_amount |
|-------------|-----------|--------------|----------------|
| MASTER_FAC  | facility  | 0            | £3.5M          |
| LOAN_A1     | loan      | £2M          | 0              |
| LOAN_A2     | loan      | £1.5M        | 0              |
| LOAN_B1     | loan      | £3M          | 0              |

**Key principles:**
- **Root facilities** carry the undrawn exposure (committed minus total drawn)
- **Loans** carry the drawn exposure
- RWA is calculated on both drawn and undrawn portions separately
- Intermediate sub-facilities are excluded from the reporting view (their committed amounts are reflected in the root facility's undrawn)

### Amount Calculation

- **Drawn amounts**: Aggregated bottom-up from loans to facilities
- **Undrawn amounts**: Calculated at root facility level as `committed - aggregated_drawn`
- **Risk parameters**: Inherited top-down (exposure_class, pd, lgd, cqs)


## Credit Risk Mitigation

Collateral can be linked at three levels in the exposure hierarchy, providing flexibility in how security is allocated.

### Allocation Levels

| Level | Link Field | Behaviour |
|-------|------------|-----------|
| **Counterparty** | `counterparty_id` | Expands to all exposures of the counterparty |
| **Facility** | `facility_id` | Expands to facility + all descendant loans |
| **Loan** | `exposure_ids` | Direct allocation to specific exposures |

**Priority:** If multiple fields are populated, the most specific wins: `exposure_ids` > `facility_id` > `counterparty_id`

### Example: Counterparty-Level Collateral

**Setup:**
```
Counterparty: CPTY001
├── FAC001 (Master Facility, £0 drawn, £5M committed)
│   ├── LOAN_A (£2M drawn, RW=100%)
│   └── LOAN_B (£1M drawn, RW=50%)
└── FAC002 (Master Facility, £0 drawn, £2M committed)
    └── LOAN_C (£1.5M drawn, RW=75%)

Collateral: £2M cash linked to counterparty_id=CPTY001
```

**Allocation Result (RWA-optimized):**

| Exposure | Drawn | Risk Weight | Collateral Allocated | Net Exposure |
|----------|-------|-------------|---------------------|--------------|
| LOAN_A   | £2M   | 100%        | £2M (priority)      | £0           |
| LOAN_B   | £1M   | 50%         | £0                  | £1M          |
| LOAN_C   | £1.5M | 75%         | £0                  | £1.5M        |
| FAC001   | £0    | -           | £0                  | £0           |
| FAC002   | £0    | -           | £0                  | £0           |

**RWA Benefit:** £2M × 100% = **£2M RWA saved** (allocated to highest RW exposure first)

### Example: Facility-Level Collateral

**Setup:**
```
FAC001 (Master Facility)
├── LOAN_A (£500k drawn, RW=100%)
└── LOAN_B (£300k drawn, RW=50%)

Collateral: £400k cash linked to facility_id=FAC001
```

**Allocation Result (RWA-optimized):**

| Exposure | Drawn | Risk Weight | Collateral Allocated | Net Exposure |
|----------|-------|-------------|---------------------|--------------|
| LOAN_A   | £500k | 100%        | £400k (priority)    | £100k        |
| LOAN_B   | £300k | 50%         | £0                  | £300k        |
| FAC001   | £0    | -           | £0                  | £0           |

**RWA Benefit:** £400k × 100% = **£400k RWA saved**

### Example: Loan-Level Collateral

**Setup:**
```
Collateral: £200k cash linked to exposure_ids="LOAN_A,LOAN_B"
- LOAN_A: £300k drawn, RW=75%
- LOAN_B: £200k drawn, RW=100%
```

**Allocation Result (RWA-optimized):**

| Exposure | Drawn | Risk Weight | Collateral Allocated | Net Exposure |
|----------|-------|-------------|---------------------|--------------|
| LOAN_B   | £200k | 100%        | £200k (priority)    | £0           |
| LOAN_A   | £300k | 75%         | £0                  | £300k        |

**RWA Benefit:** £200k × 100% = **£200k RWA saved**

### Collateral Data Format

```python
collateral_df = pl.DataFrame({
    "external_id": ["COL001", "COL002", "COL003"],
    # Choose ONE allocation level per collateral item:
    "counterparty_id": ["CPTY001", None, None],      # Counterparty level
    "facility_id": [None, "FAC001", None],           # Facility level
    "exposure_ids": [None, None, "LOAN_A,LOAN_B"],   # Loan level
    "value": [2_000_000, 400_000, 200_000],
    "collateral_type": ["cash", "cash", "gold"],
})
```

### Two-Pass Optimization

When collateral covers multiple exposures, the calculator uses a two-pass approach:

1. **Pass 1:** Calculate preliminary risk weights (without CRM)
2. **Pass 2:** Allocate collateral to highest risk-weight exposures first

This maximises capital benefit per Basel CRE22 guidance.


## Exposure Classification

Exposure class and approach are dynamically determined from counterparty attributes:

```python
from rwa_calc.engine.classification import classify_exposures
from rwa_calc.domain.enums import ApproachType

# Define IRB permissions by exposure class
irb_permissions = {
    "corporates": ApproachType.AIRB,
    "corporates_sme": ApproachType.FIRB,
    "retail_mortgage": ApproachType.AIRB,
}

# Classify exposures
result = classify_exposures(exposures_df, counterparties_df, irb_permissions)
# Adds: exposure_class, approach columns
```

### Classification Logic

1. **SA Exposure Class** (determined in precedence order):
   1. `is_securitisation` → SECURITISATION
   2. `is_ciu` → CIUS
   3. `is_subordinated` → SUBORDINATED_DEBT; `counterparty_type=equity` → EQUITY
   4. `is_high_risk` → HIGH_RISK
   5. `is_defaulted` → DEFAULTED
   6. `is_covered_bond` → COVERED_BONDS
   7. LTV ratio + product type → REAL_ESTATE_* (ADC, IPRE, Commercial, Residential)
   8. `is_international_org` → INTERNATIONAL_ORGANISATIONS
   9. `is_mdb` → MULTILATERAL_DEVELOPMENT_BANKS
   10. `is_financial_institution` → INSTITUTIONS
   11. `is_central_bank` → CENTRAL_GOVERNMENTS
   12. `is_regional_gov` → REGIONAL_GOVERNMENTS
   13. `is_pse` → PUBLIC_SECTOR_ENTITIES
   14. `is_individual` + product → RETAIL_MORTGAGE/QRRE/OTHER
   15. `is_sme` → CORPORATES_SME; `counterparty_type=corporate` → CORPORATES
   16. Otherwise → OTHER

2. **IRB Exposure Class** (for IRB-permitted exposures):
   - Corporates: Sub-classified by revenue threshold (£440m) and specialised lending criteria
   - Retail: Sub-classified by property security, QRRE criteria, and SME threshold (£0.88m)
   - **Note**: Central govs, Equity, CIUs must use SA (IRB withdrawn)

3. **Approach** (from IRB permissions + data availability):
   - A-IRB: Permitted + `has_internal_rating` + `has_internal_lgd`
   - F-IRB: Permitted + `has_internal_rating`
   - Standardised: Default fallback


## Provisions & Impairments

The calculator fully integrates IFRS 9 provisions/impairments into both SA and IRB calculations.

### SA Provisions (PRA PS9/24 Chapter 3)

For Standardised Approach exposures:

1. **Exposure Value Reduction**: Gross exposure is reduced by eligible provisions (SCRA + GCRA)
2. **Defaulted Exposure Risk Weight**: Based on SCRA coverage ratio
   - SCRA coverage >= 20% of unsecured portion → **100% RW**
   - SCRA coverage < 20% of unsecured portion → **150% RW**

```python
from rwa_calc.engine.provisions import run_sa_provision_adjustments

# Apply provision adjustments to SA exposures
adjusted_df = run_sa_provision_adjustments(exposures_df)
# Adds: provision_adjusted_ev, unsecured_portion, scra_coverage_ratio
```

### IRB Provisions (PRA PS9/24 Chapter 5)

For IRB exposures, provisions are compared to Expected Loss:

1. **Regulatory EL**: Calculated as `PD × LGD × EAD`
2. **EL Shortfall** (Provisions < EL): Deducted from CET1 capital
3. **EL Excess** (Provisions > EL): Added to Tier 2 capital (capped at 0.6% of IRB RWA)

```python
from rwa_calc.engine.provisions import calculate_portfolio_el_comparison

# Calculate portfolio-level EL vs provisions comparison
el_result = calculate_portfolio_el_comparison(irb_results_df)
print(f"Regulatory EL: {el_result.total_regulatory_el:,.0f}")
print(f"Eligible Provisions: {el_result.total_eligible_provisions:,.0f}")
print(f"EL Shortfall (CET1 deduction): {el_result.el_shortfall:,.0f}")
print(f"Tier 2 Addition: {el_result.tier2_addition:,.0f}")
```

### F-IRB Collateral-Based LGD (PRA PS9/24 Chapter 5)

For F-IRB exposures, supervisory LGD values depend on the collateral type securing the exposure:

| Collateral Type | Supervisory LGD |
|-----------------|-----------------|
| Cash, Gold, Securities | 0% |
| Receivables | 35% |
| Commercial/Residential RE | 35% |
| Other Physical | 40% |
| Unsecured | 45% |
| **Subordinated (any)** | **75%** |

When an exposure is partially secured, the effective LGD is blended:

```
effective_lgd = coverage × lgd_secured + (1 - coverage) × 45%
```

**Example: 50% Collateralised by Cash**
```
Exposure: £1,000,000 (senior)
Collateral: £500,000 cash
Coverage ratio: 50%

Effective LGD = 50% × 0% + 50% × 45% = 22.5%
```

The CRM processor automatically tracks the `primary_collateral_type` (highest allocation value) for each exposure, which flows through to the F-IRB LGD calculation.

## IRB Formula

The IRB capital requirement (K) is calculated as:

```
K = LGD × N[(1-R)^(-0.5) × G(PD) + (R/(1-R))^(0.5) × G(0.999)] - PD × LGD
```

Where:
- `N(x)` = Standard normal cumulative distribution
- `G(x)` = Inverse standard normal
- `R` = Asset correlation (varies by exposure class - see below)
- `PD` = Probability of Default (floored)
- `LGD` = Loss Given Default

Risk Weight = K × 12.5

### Asset Correlation (R) by Exposure Class

The correlation parameter R varies by exposure class and determines the sensitivity to systematic risk:

| Exposure Class | Correlation Formula | Parameters |
|----------------|---------------------|------------|
| **Corporate / Institution** | R = 0.12 × f(PD) + 0.24 × (1 - f(PD)) | R_min=12%, R_max=24% |
| **Corporate SME** | R_corp × [1 - 0.04 × (1 - (min(S,50)-5)/45)] | Firm-size adjustment |
| **Retail Mortgage** | R = 0.15 (fixed) | 15% |
| **QRRE** | R = 0.04 (fixed) | 4% |
| **Other Retail** | R = 0.03 × f(PD) + 0.16 × (1 - f(PD)) | R_min=3%, R_max=16% |

**PD-dependent function:**
- Corporate/Institution: `f(PD) = (1 - e^(-50×PD)) / (1 - e^(-50))`
- Other Retail: `f(PD) = (1 - e^(-35×PD)) / (1 - e^(-35))`

**SME Firm-Size Adjustment:**
- S = Annual turnover in EUR millions
- Applied when turnover < EUR 50m
- Reduces correlation by up to 4% for smallest firms (S=5m)

**Correlation Interpretation:**
- Higher correlation → Higher RW (more systematic risk)
- QRRE (4%) has lowest correlation - reflects granular, idiosyncratic risk
- Mortgages (15%) are fixed - residential RE portfolio shows consistent systematic behaviour
- Corporates/Institutions (12-24%) have highest correlation - more exposed to economic cycles

### Maturity Adjustment (Non-Retail Only)

```
MA = (1 + (M - 2.5) × b) / (1 - 1.5 × b)
where b = (0.11852 - 0.05478 × ln(PD))²
```

- M = Effective maturity (F-IRB: 2.5 years default; A-IRB: bank estimate, 1-5 years)
- **Retail exposures do not have maturity adjustment** (MA = 1.0)

## Output Floor (PRA PS9/24 Chapter 6)

The output floor ensures IRB RWA is at least 72.5% of what SA RWA would be:

```
Total Standardised Equivalent = SA RWA + IRB SA Equivalent RWA
Floor = 72.5% × Total Standardised Equivalent
Final RWA = max(Actual RWA, Floor)
```

The `OutputFloorResult` provides full visibility:

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `sa_rwa` | RWA for exposures using SA approach |
| `irb_rwa` | RWA for exposures using IRB approach |
| `irb_sa_equivalent_rwa` | What IRB exposures would have been under SA |
| `total_standardised_equivalent` | SA RWA + IRB SA Equivalent |
| `floor_rwa` | 72.5% × Total Standardised Equivalent |
| `floor_binding` | True if floor > actual RWA |
| `final_rwa` | max(actual, floor) |
| `irb_benefit` | RWA reduction from using IRB |
