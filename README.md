# UK Credit Risk RWA Calculator

[![Documentation](https://img.shields.io/badge/docs-GitHub%20Pages-blue)](https://OpenAfterHours.github.io/rwa_calculator/)

A high-performance Risk-Weighted Assets (RWA) calculator for UK credit risk, supporting both current regulations and future Basel 3.1 implementation. Built with Python using Polars for vectorized performance.

**Documentation:** [https://OpenAfterHours.github.io/rwa_calculator/](https://OpenAfterHours.github.io/rwa_calculator/)

## Installation

```bash
# Install from PyPI
pip install rwa-calc

# Or with uv
uv add rwa-calc

# With UI support (web-based calculator interface)
pip install rwa-calc[ui]

# With fast stats backend (native Polars, recommended for performance)
pip install rwa-calc[fast-stats]

# Recommended: both UI and fast stats
pip install rwa-calc[fast-stats,ui]
```

### Optional Dependencies

| Extra | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `fast-stats` | Native Polars statistical functions via `polars-normal-stats` (faster IRB calculations) |
| `ui` | Interactive web UI via Marimo |
| `dev` | Development tools (pytest, mypy, mkdocs) |
| `all` | All optional dependencies |

**Note:** The calculator works without `fast-stats` by using `scipy` as a fallback. Install `fast-stats` for optimal performance in production.

## Quick Start

**Option 1: Interactive UI**

```bash
pip install rwa-calc[ui]
rwa-calc-ui
# Open http://localhost:8000 in your browser
```

**Option 2: Python API**

```python
from datetime import date
from rwa_calc.engine.pipeline import create_pipeline
from rwa_calc.contracts.config import CalculationConfig

config = CalculationConfig.crr(reporting_date=date(2026, 12, 31))
pipeline = create_pipeline()
result = pipeline.run(config)

print(f"Total RWA: {result.total_rwa:,.2f}")
```

## Regulatory Scope

This calculator supports two regulatory regimes:

| Regime | Effective Period | UK Implementation | Status |
|--------|------------------|-------------------|--------|
| **CRR (Basel 3.0)** | Until 31 December 2026 | UK CRR (EU 575/2013 as onshored) | **Active Development** |
| **Basel 3.1** | From 1 January 2027 | PRA PS9/24 | Planned |

A configuration toggle allows switching between calculation modes for:
- Current regulatory reporting under UK CRR
- Impact analysis and parallel running ahead of Basel 3.1 go-live
- Seamless transition when Basel 3.1 becomes effective

## Key Features

- **Dual-Framework Support**: Single codebase for CRR and Basel 3.1 with UK-specific deviations
- **High Performance**: Polars LazyFrames for vectorized calculations (50-100x improvement over row iteration)
- **Complete Coverage**: Standardised (SA), IRB (F-IRB & A-IRB), and Slotting approaches
- **Credit Risk Mitigation**: Collateral, guarantees, and provisions with RWA-optimized allocation
- **Complex Hierarchies**: Multi-level counterparty and facility hierarchy support
- **Audit Trail**: Full calculation transparency for regulatory review

### Supported Approaches

| Approach | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| Standardised (SA) | Risk weights based on external ratings and exposure characteristics |
| Foundation IRB (F-IRB) | Bank-estimated PD, supervisory LGD |
| Advanced IRB (A-IRB) | Bank-estimated PD, LGD, and EAD |
| Slotting | Category-based approach for specialised lending |

### Supported Exposure Classes

Sovereign, Institution, Corporate, Corporate SME, Retail Mortgage, Retail QRRE, Retail Other, Specialised Lending, Equity
