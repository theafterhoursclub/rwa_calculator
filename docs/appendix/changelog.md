## Migration Notes

### From Previous Versions

This is the initial release. No migration required.

### CRR to Basel 3.1

When transitioning calculations from CRR to Basel 3.1:

1. **Update configuration:**
   ```python
   # Before (CRR)
   config = CalculationConfig.crr(date(2026, 12, 31))

   # After (Basel 3.1)
   config = CalculationConfig.basel_3_1(date(2027, 1, 1))
   ```

2. **Review impacted exposures:**
   - SME exposures (factor removal)
   - Infrastructure exposures (factor removal)
   - Low-risk IRB portfolios (output floor)

3. **Update data requirements:**
   - LTV data for Basel 3.1 real estate weights
   - Transactor/revolver flags for QRRE

## Deprecation Notices

### CRR-Specific Features (End of 2026)

The following CRR-specific features will be removed from active use after December 2026:

- SME supporting factor
- Infrastructure supporting factor
- 1.06 scaling factor

These will remain available for historical calculations and comparison.
