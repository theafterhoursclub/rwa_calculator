# Glossary

This glossary provides definitions for key terms used throughout the documentation.

## A

### A-IRB (Advanced Internal Ratings-Based)
An IRB approach where the bank estimates PD, LGD, and EAD using internal models, subject to regulatory floors and approval.

### Asset Correlation
A measure of how closely the value of an asset moves with systematic risk factors. Higher correlation means more sensitivity to economic conditions.

## B

## C

### Capital Requirement
The minimum amount of capital a bank must hold against its risk exposures. Calculated as RWA × Capital Ratio.

### CCF (Credit Conversion Factor)
A percentage applied to off-balance sheet exposures to convert them to on-balance sheet equivalents for capital calculation.

### CQS (Credit Quality Step)
A standardized credit quality scale (1-6) used to map external credit ratings to risk weights.

### CRE (Credit Risk - Real Estate)

### DPD (Days Past Due)
The number of days a payment is overdue.

## E

### EAD (Exposure at Default)
The expected exposure amount at the time of default. For on-balance sheet items, typically the gross carrying amount.

### ECRA (External Credit Risk Assessment Approach)
Basel 3.1 approach for institutions using external ratings.

### EL (Expected Loss)
The anticipated loss on a portfolio. Calculated as PD × LGD × EAD.

### Exposure Class
A regulatory classification of exposures (Sovereign, Institution, Corporate, Retail, etc.) that determines applicable risk weights.

## F

### F-IRB (Foundation Internal Ratings-Based)
An IRB approach where the bank estimates PD but uses supervisory values for LGD and CCF.

### Financial Collateral
Liquid assets (cash, bonds, equity) used as security for credit exposures.

## G

### GCRA (General Credit Risk Adjustment)
General provisions not allocated to specific exposures. May be included in Tier 2 capital.

### Guarantee
Credit protection provided by a third party. Allows substitution of the guarantor's risk weight.

## H

### HVCRE (High Volatility Commercial Real Estate)
Speculative commercial real estate development with higher risk weights.

## I

### Infrastructure Factor
CRR capital relief factor (0.75) for qualifying infrastructure project finance. Removed under Basel 3.1.

### IPRE (Income-Producing Real Estate)
Real estate generating rental or sale income. Receives specialised treatment under slotting approach.

### IRB (Internal Ratings-Based)
Approaches allowing banks to use internal risk estimates for capital calculation, subject to regulatory approval.

## K

### K (Capital Requirement)
The IRB formula output representing the capital requirement as a percentage of EAD.

## L

### LazyFrame
A Polars data structure representing deferred (lazy) computations on data, enabling query optimization.

### LGD (Loss Given Default)
The percentage of exposure lost if default occurs, after accounting for recoveries.

### LTV (Loan-to-Value)
The ratio of a loan amount to the value of the underlying collateral (typically property).

## M

### MA (Maturity Adjustment)
An adjustment factor in the IRB formula accounting for increased risk of longer-dated exposures.

### MDB (Multilateral Development Bank)
International financial institutions (World Bank, EIB, etc.) that may receive preferential risk weights.

## O

### Output Floor
Basel 3.1 requirement that IRB RWA cannot fall below 72.5% of the equivalent SA RWA.

## P

### PD (Probability of Default)
The likelihood that a counterparty will default within one year. Range: 0% to 100%.

### PRA (Prudential Regulation Authority)
The UK banking regulator responsible for implementing Basel standards.

### PSE (Public Sector Entity)
Non-commercial government bodies that may receive preferential treatment.

## Q

### QRRE (Qualifying Revolving Retail Exposures)
Unsecured revolving credit to individuals (credit cards, overdrafts) meeting specific criteria.

## R

### RGLA (Regional Government and Local Authority)
Sub-national government entities with varying risk treatments.

### Risk Weight
A percentage applied to EAD to calculate RWA. Higher risk weights indicate higher risk.

### RWA (Risk-Weighted Assets)
Assets adjusted for risk, used to calculate capital requirements. RWA = EAD × Risk Weight.

## S

### SA (Standardised Approach)
A capital calculation approach using regulatory-prescribed risk weights based on external ratings.

### Scaling Factor
CRR 1.06 multiplier applied to all IRB RWA. Removed under Basel 3.1.

### SCRA (Specific Credit Risk Adjustment)
Provisions allocated to specific exposures. Reduces EAD for SA, compares to EL for IRB.

### SCRA (Standardised Credit Risk Assessment Approach)
Basel 3.1 approach for unrated institutions based on capital adequacy ratios.

### Slotting Approach
A capital calculation method for specialised lending using supervisory categories (Strong/Good/Satisfactory/Weak).

### SME (Small and Medium Enterprise)
Companies with turnover ≤ EUR 50m qualifying for preferential treatment.

### SME Supporting Factor
CRR capital relief factor (0.7619/0.85) for SME exposures. Removed under Basel 3.1.

### Sovereign
Exposure to a government or central bank.

### Specialised Lending
Project finance, object finance, commodities finance, and real estate exposures with specific treatments.

## T

### Tier 1 Capital
High-quality capital including common equity (CET1) and additional Tier 1 instruments.

### Tier 2 Capital
Supplementary capital including subordinated debt and general provisions.

## U

### Unexpected Loss (UL)
Losses above expected levels, covered by regulatory capital. UL = RWA × 8%.
