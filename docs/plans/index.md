# Project Plans

This section contains project planning documents, development roadmaps, and phase tracking for the RWA Calculator.

## Overview

The project follows a **phased, test-first approach** prioritising CRR (Basel 3.0) implementation before extending to Basel 3.1.

## Documents

- [**Development Roadmap**](roadmap.md) - Current development status, phase tracking, and implementation progress
- [**Implementation Plan**](implementation-plan.md) - Detailed acceptance test scenarios, contract definitions, and regulatory parameters

## Development Philosophy

The project adheres to these core principles:

1. **Test-Driven Development (TDD)** - Tests are written before implementation
2. **Phased Delivery** - Features are delivered incrementally with clear milestones
3. **Regulatory Accuracy** - All calculations are validated against regulatory specifications
4. **Performance First** - LazyFrame operations and vectorized calculations throughout

## Current Focus

The calculator is currently in **active development** with CRR (Basel 3.0) implementation complete and Basel 3.1 implementation planned.

See the [Development Roadmap](roadmap.md) for detailed status and progress tracking.
