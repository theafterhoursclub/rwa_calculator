# Development Roadmap

This page tracks the development status and progress of the RWA Calculator across all implementation phases.

## Phase Overview

| Phase | Description | Status |
|-------|-------------|--------|
| Phase 1 | Test Infrastructure | Complete |
| Phase 2 | Process Contracts | Complete |
| Phase 3 | Implementation | Complete |
| Phase 4 | Acceptance Testing | Complete |

---

## Phase 1: Test Infrastructure

| Component | Status | Details |
|-----------|--------|---------|
| Test Data Fixtures | Complete | 15 fixture types covering all counterparty, exposure, CRM, and mapping scenarios |
| CRR Expected Outputs | Complete | 45 scenarios across 8 groups (SA, F-IRB, A-IRB, CRM, Slotting, Supporting Factors, Provisions, Complex) |
| CRR Acceptance Tests | Complete | 83 tests (38 validation, 45 implementation stubs) |
| Basel 3.1 Expected Outputs | Not Started | Planned for Phase 1.2B |

---

## Phase 2: Process Contracts

Interfaces and contracts between RWA calculator components have been implemented:

| Component | Location | Tests |
|-----------|----------|-------|
| Domain Enums | `src/rwa_calc/domain/enums.py` | - |
| Error Contracts | `src/rwa_calc/contracts/errors.py` | 20 |
| Configuration | `src/rwa_calc/contracts/config.py` | 20 |
| Data Bundles | `src/rwa_calc/contracts/bundles.py` | 24 |
| Protocols | `src/rwa_calc/contracts/protocols.py` | 14 |
| Validation | `src/rwa_calc/contracts/validation.py` | 19 |
| **Total** | **6 modules** | **97 tests** |

### Key Features

- `CalculationConfig.crr()` and `.basel_3_1()` factory methods for framework-specific configuration
- Protocol-based interfaces (`LoaderProtocol`, `ClassifierProtocol`, etc.) for dependency injection
- `LazyFrameResult` for error accumulation without exceptions
- Intermediate pipeline schemas for data validation at component boundaries

## Phase 3: Implementation

| Component | Location | CRR Status | Basel 3.1 Status | Tests |
|-----------|----------|------------|------------------|-------|
| Domain enums | `domain/enums.py` | Complete | Complete | - |
| Risk weight tables | `data/tables/crr_risk_weights.py` | Complete | Planned | - |
| CCF tables | `engine/ccf.py` | Complete | Complete | 15 |
| Data Loader | `engine/loader.py` | Complete | Complete | 31 |
| Hierarchy Resolver | `engine/hierarchy.py` | Complete | Complete | 17 |
| Exposure Classifier | `engine/classifier.py` | Complete | Complete | 19 |
| CRM Processor | `engine/crm/processor.py` | Complete | Complete | - |
| SA Calculator | `engine/sa/calculator.py` | Complete | Complete | - |
| IRB Calculator | `engine/irb/calculator.py` | Complete | Complete | - |
| Slotting Calculator | `engine/slotting/calculator.py` | Complete | Complete | - |
| Supporting Factors | `engine/sa/supporting_factors.py` | Complete | N/A | - |
| Output Aggregator | `engine/aggregator.py` | Complete | Complete | 21 |
| Output floor | `engine/aggregator.py` | N/A | Complete | - |
| Pipeline Orchestrator | `engine/pipeline.py` | Complete | Complete | 30 |

### Key Implementation Features

- **Pure LazyFrame Operations**: Hierarchy resolution uses iterative Polars joins instead of Python dicts for 50-100x performance improvement
- **Output Floor**: Full Basel 3.1 output floor with transitional schedule support (50% to 72.5%, 2027-2032)
- **Supporting Factors**: CRR SME tiered factor (0.7619/0.85) and infrastructure factor (0.75)
- **Summary Generation**: RWA aggregation by exposure class and calculation approach
- **Pipeline Orchestrator**: Complete pipeline wiring with error accumulation and audit trail

## Phase 4: Acceptance Testing

CRR acceptance tests validate production pipeline outputs against expected values:

| Group | Description | Scenarios | Status |
|-------|-------------|-----------|--------|
| CRR-A | Standardised Approach | 12 | **10 PASS, 2 SKIP** |
| CRR-B | Foundation IRB | 6 | 6 SKIP (needs PD data) |
| CRR-C | Advanced IRB | 3 | 3 SKIP (needs fixtures) |
| CRR-D | Credit Risk Mitigation | 6 | 6 SKIP (needs fixtures) |
| CRR-E | Specialised Lending (Slotting) | 4 | 4 SKIP (needs fixtures) |
| CRR-F | Supporting Factors | 7 | 7 SKIP (needs fixtures) |
| CRR-G | Provisions & Impairments | 3 | 3 SKIP (needs fixtures) |
| CRR-H | Complex/Combined | 4 | 4 SKIP (needs fixtures) |

### Key Achievements

- Pipeline-based testing using session-scoped fixtures
- Scenario-to-exposure reference mapping for all 46 scenarios
- CRR-A (SA) tests fully operational with 10 passing tests
- Remaining tests skipped pending fixture data (PD values for IRB, collateral/guarantee data for CRM)
